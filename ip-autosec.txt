INTERNET DRAFT                 IP AutoSEC                 August 3, 2013


1  Introduction

   IP AutoSEC asymmetrically encrypts the first send datagram to any
   endpoint and starts a symmetric encrypted connection by including a
   symmetric key and encryption parameters as well as already
   symmetrically encrypted payload - all within the first packet.

   All subsequent IP datagrams will be encrypted with the provided
   symmetric key like in usual VPN or IPSEC connections.

   IP AutoSEC uses DNS-Keys to distribute the required public-keys and
   encryption parameters for endpoints and specifies a simple protocol
   sitting between the IP and any upper Layer in the internet protocol
   suite and is used only for the very first datagram of any successful
   connection while beeing replaced upon subsequent submissions with
   DNSSEC (IPv6) or VPN (IPv4).

   Unsuccessful connections may answer using the IP AutoSEC protocol to
   return error values or propose different encryption parameters or
   keys.

1.1  Typical steps

      1. Server X has public-key and accepted algorithms "AES-128;AES-
      192;AES-256" available through DNS

      2. Client A wants to view Website hosten on Server X and creates a
      HTTP GET request packed in TCP and IP

      3. Upon sending the very first IP datagram on the client IP
      AutoSEC intercepts, and:

         3.1 asks DNS for AutoSEC values of Server X

         3.2 decides which one of the accepted encryption algorithms to
         use

         3.3 generates an appropriate random symmetric key

         3.4 encrypts the TCP packet using the generated key

         3.5 creates the IP AutoSec Header, including:

             3.5.1 the generated symmetric key

             3.5.2 the used encryption parameters

             3.5.3 the original upper layer protocol identifier

         3.6 asymmetrically encrypts the IP AutoSEC Header using the
         provided public-key of server X

         3.7 assembling the final IP datagram:

            3.7.1 using the original IP-Header (from step 3)

            3.7.2 replacing the upper protocol-identifier with IP
            AutoSEC's own identifyer

            3.7.3 inserting the asymmeterically encrypted IP AutoSec
            header

            3.7.4 and appending the symmetrically encrypted payload

      4. Upon reciving this datagram the server recognizes the IP
      AutoSEC protocol identifier

         4.1 decrypts the IP AutoSEC Header using its private key

         4.2 creates IPSEC or VPN established connection

         4.3 replaces the IP AutoSEC header with a standard conform
         IPSEC Header or appropriate VPN payload

         4.4 hands over to IPSEC / VPN


2 IP AutoSEC DNS Resource Record: KEY

   IP AutoSEC uses the DNS Resource Record (RR) 'KEY' for public-keys.
   The RR 'KEY' was defined with DNSSEC (RFC2535) but is obsolete since
   2004 and hereby reused.

2.1 RR KEY Format

   The RR KEY not only transports the public-key, but all needed
   configuration-data for IP AutoSEC:

   Multiple values should be ordered by preference, most preferable
   first. Multiple values must be separated with , (comma). Encryption,
   Hash, DH and Public-Key Sections must be separated with ;
   (semicolon). Whitespace and newlines must be ignored. The Public-Key
   must be Base64 encoded.

   1. allowed encryption-algorithms, ordered by preference

   2. allowed hash-algorithms, ordered by preference

   3. Diffie-Hellman Group, ordered by preference

   4. public-key

   2.1.1 valid values for algorithms The valid values are the string
   representations as defined by IKEv2 (RFC4306) in section 3.3.2.
   Transform Structure:

   Encryption algorithms correspond to section 'Transform Type 1'
   appended by the keylength -128, -192, or -256 and includes the
   values: ENCR_DES_IV64, ENCR_DES, ENCR_3DES, ENCR_RC5, ENCR_IDEA,
   ENCR_CAST, ENCR_BLOWFISH, ENCR_3IDEA, ENCR_DES_IV32, ENCR_NULL,
   ENCR_AES_CBC, ENCR_AES_CTR

   Hash algorithms correspond to section 'Transform Type 3' as well as
   RFC 4868 and includes the values: NONE, AUTH_HMAC_MD5_96,
   AUTH_HMAC_SHA1_96, AUTH_DES_MAC, AUTH_KPDK_MD5, AUTH_AES_XCBC_96 as
   well as AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_256_128, AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_384_192 and
   AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_512_256

   Diffie-Hellman Groups correspond to section 'Transform Type 4', which
   itself references RFC 3526 and includes the values: MODP1536,
   MODP2048, MODP3072, MODP4096, MODP6144 and MODP8192

   IP AutoSEC does not insist on this specific list of algorithms but
   may be used with any other or future algorithms that are defined in
   this manner, e.g. by updates to the IKE standard. If either the
   client or the server does not support a specific algorithm IP AutoSEC
   simply does not work.

   128;AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_512_256;MODP3072,MODP2048;
