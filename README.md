ip-autosec
==========

IP AutoSEC protocol, which is designed to quickly establish IP based VPN (IPv4) or IPSEC (IPv6) connections to any endpoint supporting IP AutoSEC.

IP AutoSEC does not try to reinvent encryption or to estabish a new protocol as the author does not feel himself capable of doing this.

Instead IP AutoSEC simply reuses VPN / IPSEC, but instead of configuring the information locally it suggests to push everything on public DNS-Servers, so everyone can start a encrypted VPN / IPSEC connection with anyone else immediately.


This project is 'work in progress' and not yet finished. The goal is to submit a working and clean INTERNET-DRAFT to the IETF.
