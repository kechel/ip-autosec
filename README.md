ip-autosec
==========

IP AutoSEC is a protocol proposal, which is designed to quickly establish 
IP based VPN (IPv4) or IPSEC (IPv6) connections to any endpoint supporting IP AutoSEC.

IP AutoSEC does not try to reinvent encryption or a new protocol.
Instead IP AutoSEC simply reuses VPN / IPSEC, but instead of configuring the 
information locally it suggests to push everything on public DNS-Servers, so 
everyone can start a encrypted VPN / IPSEC connection with anyone else immediately.

This project is 'work in progress' and not yet finished. The goal is to submit a 
working and clean INTERNET-DRAFT to the IETF.

The file ip-autosec.txt is automatically generated from ip-autosec.nroff, and 
it's only here for convenience of readers.
